    <h1>Professional Career</h1>
        <p>
            How Long Lebron James has been in NBA? Let's take a litlle detailed look:
        </p> 

            <h3>Cleveland Cavaliers 2003-2010</h3>

        <p>
           The Cleveland Cavaliers selected LeBron James first overall in the 2003 draft. Even though he was
           only 18 years old, he received immediate acclaim as a prodigy. In fact, he scored 25 points in the first
           game of the regular season. After seven seasons with the Cavaliers, he eventually rose to the position
           of team's all-time leading scorer.
        </p>

            <h3>Miami Heat 2010-2014</h3>

        <p>
            When James joined the Miami Heat in 2010, he surprised the basketball world by leaving the Cleveland
            Cavaliers. Several clubs reached out to him during this period, but he finally chose Miami for the 
            chance to keep winning.During this time, analysts, followers, and even ex-players like Michael Jordan 
            and Magic Johnson harshly condemned James.            
        </p>

            <h3>LeBron returns to Cleveland  2014-2018</h3>

        <p>
            James rejoined the Cavaliers in 2014 with the goal of winning a championship in his native city. In each 
            of his four seasons back in Cleveland, he guided the group to the NBA Finals, earning the title in 2016.
            The Cavaliers made NBA history by becoming the first club to win a Finals series after falling behind 3-1. 
            LeBron, who averages nearly a triple-double of 29.7 points, 11.3 rebounds, and 8.9 assists, contributed to 
            opening up the door. He accomplished a triple-double in a game 7 to become just the third player in history.
        </p>

            <h3>Los Angeles Lakers  2018-present</h3>

        <p>
            LeBron joined the Lakers in 2018, and despite many setbacks, he still rules the Western Conference with averages
            of 25, 7, and 8. The Lakers had trouble finding lineup cohesion in 2018 because their team was comprised of a 
            contentious group of veterans.
